# 02-Text-adventure
This is a text maze adventure. Drawing a 5x6 grid may be helpful in tracing your steps. I set up the maze so that you could use the hedge trimmers to create a shortcut at "D4". But I was not aware that allowing the use of items in a specific place which in turn opens a new exit was way beyond my coding capabilities. Nevertheless, trying for hours to figure it out via Stack Overflow was quite informative and proved to be a much needed catch up since missing a number of classes due to the flu. I'm aware you can only get up to 8 points for number of locations. However, I hope my (maybe overly) ambitious adventure map counts as "beyond the scope of the assignment" and earns me a few points to help make up for the late submission. 

Speaking of make up points--I'm not sure if you are even still reading this--I recall on the first day of class you mentioning extra credit givin to those who help the community. This may be a stretch but I am always very attentive to missing pet posters. 10 days ago I sought out a missing cat whose posters were all around my apartment complex and I FOUND HIM! I took him in and fed him and his mom was ecstatic and hadnt seen him in a whole month! It was quite rewarding in itself and Iv'e been keeping a keen eye out for a "Mr.Mittens" who is currently at large. Anyway, my point is I would love to try and make up for some lost points. If you have any suggestions for alternate ways to help out the community, I would be much abliged.

I hope you enjoy the maze!

Cheers,
